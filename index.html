            <p style="display: inline-block; width: 70%; text-align: center; padding-left: 15%;">
                NFTsLATAM is Excited to share with you these two initiatives to help EtherTulip get things going in the right way.
            </p>
        
            <div class="invite">
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    There are two main ideas that we think are going to help on a smooth relaunch of the project: <br />
                    <b>1. Pixel art</b> contest for <a href="./contest.html">V2.</a><br />
                    <b>2. Alliance</b> with a <a href="./proarte.html">physical gallery</a> to display digital exhibits on their behalf.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <b>first</b> idea has been considered in order to accomplish three things: <br />
                    <ol>
                        <li>Community interaction</li>
                        <li>Community growth</li>
                        <li>Social Impact</li>
                    </ol>
                    It is extremely important to try and create a positive impact on the NFT community, something to help 
                    "compensate" the time of absense. Having a contest with a high value/price incentive could help trigger 
                    the same response EtherTulip had during the launching/minting period. <br />
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <b>second</b> idea is in order to achieve a local collaboration to link the digital endeavors to real life
                    exhibits. Linking the project with a local exclusive gallery will help promote the project and add a degree
                    of reliability right off the bat. <br />
                    With this collaboration we are looking to add the digital component to physical art as well as 'backing'
                    digital art with physical pieces. The long term goal is to create a physical Gallery for EtherTulip with 
                    tokenized art work and a community collection of high quality art. Selling and displaying both physical and
                    digital work.<br /> 
                </p>

                <h4>Review after reading both proposals.</h4>

                <p>
                    For these two reasons we will like to request an additional 12K seed funding in order to cover for: <br />
                    <b>1.</b> $1,000 for the 3D modeling of the physical gallery.<br />
                    <b>2.</b> 5ETH (~$9,000) for the winner of the pixel art contest. <br />
                    <b>3.</b> $2,000 for aggresive marketing to promote the contest. <br />
