                NFTsLATAM is excited to share with you these two initiatives to help EtherTulip get things going in the right direction.
            </p>
        
            <div class="invite">
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    There are two main ideas that we think are going to help on a smooth relaunch of the project: <br />
                    <b>1. Pixel art</b> contest for V2.<br />
                    <b>2. Alliance</b> with a physical gallery to display digital exhibits on their behalf.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <b>first</b> idea has been considered in order to accomplish three things: <br />
                    <ol>
                        <li>Community interaction</li>
                        <li>Community growth</li>
                        <li>Social Impact</li>
                    </ol>
                    It is extremely important to try and create a positive impact on the NFT community, something to help 
                    "compensate" the time of absense. Having a contest with a high value/price incentive could help trigger 
                    the same response EtherTulip had during the launching/minting period. <br />
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <b>second</b> idea is in order to achieve a local collaboration to link the digital endeavors to real life
                    exhibits. Linking the project with a local exclusive gallery will help promote the project and add a degree
                    of reliability right off the bat. <br />
                    With this collaboration we are looking to add the digital component to physical art as well as 'backing'
                    digital art with physical art. The long term goal is to create a physical Gallery for EtherTulips with 
                    tokenized art work and a community collection of high quality art. <br /> 
                </p>
                
                <h4>EtherTulip V2 Concept</h4>
            
<!--             ALTERNATIVE TEXT  -->
                <p>
                    EtherTulip V2 aims to foster growth in our community and spur the development of community-driven concepts. To achieve this, we plan to introduce a perpetual
                    gardener mint, adding 365 new members annually and generating funds for continuous development. <br />
                    <br />
                    In the spirit of community participation, the V2 art will be 
                    chosen through a <a href="./contest.html" style="color:darkblue; font-weight: 900;">contest</a>. Artists are invited to submit their work during a 45-day period, allowing ample time for participation and building momentum in the community.
                    The winner artist will then prepare the necessary traits for the V2 collection. <br /> 
                    Following the art selection, we will initiate a free minting phase for existing EtherTulip 
                    and $PETAL holders who meet a certain threshold. Upon completion of the first minting process, we will launch the perpetual minting system, commencing with a 31-day free mint, 
                    followed by a dutch auction minting system. <br />
                    <br />
                    Parallel to these developments, EtherTulip, in collaboration with Fundaci√≥n Proarte, will create a <a href="./proarte.html" style="color:darkblue; font-weight: bolder;">digital gallery</a>. This will be a 
                    dedicated space on our website where community members can purchase digital (and eventually physical) art pieces from exhibiting artists using both $PETAL and $ETH. Ideally, each artist 
                    will also create a small EtherTulip canvas to be auctioned in $PETAL, enhancing the credibility and trust of our community while creating tangible value for members. <br />
                    <br />
                    In anticipation of the V2 launch, three NFTs demonstrating the V2 Twin NFT concept will be minted by NFTsLATAM or EtherTulip using EtherTulip's wallet. This step is designed to 
                    introduce the innovative aspect of the V2 collection and serves as proof of concept to prevent copying. <br />
                    <br />
                    Also, it is imporant to note that we have agreed a collaboration with Maureen Gubia. She has a strong background in experimenting with various digital techniques and is enthusiastic about working on the pixel art 
                    prototype and concept.  Please find a brief description of the artist <a href="./maureen.html">here</a>.

                <p>
                    To support these initiatives, we are requesting an additional $15,000 in seed funding for: <br />

                    <b>1. </b>$1,000 for 3D modeling of the physical and digital-only gallery. <br />
                    <b>2. </b>5ETH (approximately $9,000) as a prize for the art contest winner. <br />
                    <b>3. </b>$2,000 for marketing to promote the contest. <br />
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    <span style="font-size:small">Please note that additional funds will be needed to cover gas fees for minting and other contract-related expenses. We are confident that with these resources, EtherTulip V2 will be a successful progression of our project, offering innovative features and valuable community involvement. </span> <br />
