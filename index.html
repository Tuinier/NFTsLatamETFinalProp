            <h1>EtherTulip</h1>
            <h2>The Tulips' Brand!</h2>
            <p style="display: inline-block; width: 70%; text-align: center; padding-left: 15%;">
                NFTsLATAM is Excited to share with you these two initiatives to help EtherTulip get things going in the right direction.
            </p>
        
            <div class="invite">
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    There are two main ideas that we think are going to help on a smooth relaunch of the project: <br />
                    <b>1. Pixel art</b> contest for V2.<br />
                    <b>2. Alliance</b> with a physical gallery to display digital exhibits on their behalf.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <b>first</b> idea has been considered in order to accomplish three things: <br />
                    <ol>
                        <li>Community interaction</li>
                        <li>Community growth</li>
                        <li>Social Impact</li>
                    </ol>
                    It is extremely important to try and create a positive impact on the NFT community, something to help 
                    "compensate" the time of absense. Having a contest with a high value/price incentive could help trigger 
                    the same response EtherTulip had during the launching/minting period. <br />
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <b>second</b> idea is in order to achieve a local collaboration to link the digital endeavors to real life
                    exhibits. Linking the project with a local exclusive gallery will help promote the project and add a degree
                    of reliability right off the bat. <br />
                    With this collaboration we are looking to add the digital component to physical art as well as 'backing'
                    digital art with physical art. The long term goal is to create a physical Gallery for EtherTulips with 
                    tokenized art work and a community collection of high quality art. <br /> 
                </p>
                
                <h4>EtherTulip V2 Concept</h4>
                <p>
                    A perpetual gardener (tuinier) mint, one per day, in a similar manner to EtherTulip's Dutch auction mechanism. This mint will 
                    add 365 new members to the community per year plus adding funds to continue developing community driven  ideas and concepts.<br />
                    The V2 art will be chosen by the community and artists that submitted their work in order to participate on the 
                    <a href="./contest.html" style="color:darkblue; font-weight: 900;">contest</a>. The first 45 days should be dedicated to the contest development, giving artists enough time to participate
                    and for the community to create momentum around it. <br />
                    Once the art is chosen and the artist has worked on all the traits needed in order to create the V2 collection we will
                    begin the free mint for EtherTulip holders and $PETAL holders (above certain treshold number). <br />
                    After this first minting process is over we can launch the perpetual minting, one per day, maybe do the first 31 days 
                    a free mint (still one per day), and right after starts the dutch auction minting system. <br />
                    <br />
                    In parallel the EtherTulip's Brand will develop it's <a href="./proarte.html" style="color:darkblue; font-weight: bolder;">digital gallery</a> alongisde Fundaci√≥n Proarte. Adding a section to our
                    website where community members can buy the exhibiting artists digital pieces (eventually phsyical as well) with both $PETAL
                    and $ETH. <br />
                    This digital gallery will replicate the best exhibits being organized phsyically by Proarte and will have a digital-only space
                    at the end of the hall dedicated to EtherTulip. <br />
                    Ideally, every exhibiting artist will create a small canvas version of the EtherTulip (physical) to be auctioned on $PETAL.
                    This collaboration can help achieve a higher credibility and level of confidence among the community while creating real value 
                    for members. <br />
                    <br />
                    Three NFTs will be minted by NFTsLATAM (or by EtherTulip using EtherTulip's wallet) next week (by 05.27.23) in order for artists and community
                    members to review the V2 Twin NFT concept. This will be done to add this innovation aspect to the V2 collection and as a proof of concept/authenticity 
                    to avoid being copied before the V2 launch. 
                    <br />
                </p>

                <h4>Review after reading both <a href="./contest.html" style="color:darkblue; font-weight: 900;">ideas</a>/<a href="./proarte.html" style="color:darkblue; font-weight: bolder;">proposals</a>.</h4>
                
                <p>
                    To achieve these two goals we will like to request an additional 15K seed funding in order to cover for: <br />
                    <b>1.</b> $1,000 for the 3D modeling of the physical gallery plus the digital-only gallery.<br />
                    <b>2.</b> 5ETH (~$9,000) for the winner of the art contest. <br />
                    <b>3.</b> $2,000 for marketing to promote the contest. <br /> 
                    <b>*</b> Additional funds will be required to cover for gas fees when minting contract and other contract interactions. <br />
